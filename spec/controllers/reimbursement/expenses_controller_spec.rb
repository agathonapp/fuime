# FUIME-DISABLED (2026-09-15): this whole file runs with :sponsor_banking on.
#
# `reimbursement/expenses` is now in
# Fuime::DisabledModules::SPONSOR_BANKING_CONTROLLER_PREFIXES, so every
# state-changing request in here is refused for a non-admin while the flag is
# off — which is Fuime's shipping posture. A reimbursement report settles through
# `ach_transfer || increase_check || paypal_transfer || wire || wise_transfer`
# and `PayoutHoldingService::ProcessSingle` posts a Column book transfer, none of
# which this fork has (see Event::Plan#reimbursements_enabled?).
#
# Tagged rather than skipped, deliberately. These examples pin real
# authorization rules — an attacker cannot move a report or an expense onto
# another venture, a payout method must belong to the user — that are worth
# keeping green for the day this is rebuilt on Fuime::PayoutRequest. Skipping
# them would let those rules rot; running them in the world where the module is
# on keeps them honest without pretending the module is on today.
